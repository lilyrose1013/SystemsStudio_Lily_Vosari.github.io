    <h1>Project 1 Self as Systems</h1>
    <h2>This is the Project 1: <br> 
        Self as System:  </h2>
    <h3>My ideation behind this project was based on the emotional connection between music and my emotions <br>
        after downloading my data from Spotify and simplifying the data into a 2 day period. I wanted to represent my emotional state through colors and shapes <br>
that would represent my most listened to songs and artists thought shapes, with the larger shapes typically representing my most listened to songs. <br>
I wanted to use color to help in the representation with colors relaying the mood of the songs along with the typical color representations displayed within<br>modern media.
